### Projects

#### 1. Tesla Supercharing Stations Prediction
[Link](https://github.com/anjanibond/Data-Science/tree/main/Portfolio/Project1)
Of all the various brands in the current market, Tesla is clearly the market leader not just because of the brand value and design but mostly because of the reliable Tesla supercharging stations. The public charging stations had their share of problems as they sometimes don’t work which is quite frustrating to the EV car owners. One of the key features for prospective EV car buyers is charging stations. I will be exploring more on this aspect where it might be useful for upcoming EV buyers to make purchase based on the charging stations and their possible expansion pattern/prediction. The focus of this model is limited to USA.


#### 2. Air Travel Safety
[Link](https://github.com/anjanibond/Data-Science/tree/main/Portfolio/Project2)
Travelling in airplane is making your life at risk. Air travel is risky compared to other modes of transportation. Likewise, there has been a lot of chatter in the media regarding the airline crashes and fatalities occurred in recent times. With several incidents in recent times, you might get an impression that these days, you are taking your life at stake by travelling in airplane instead of other modes of transportation like automobiles. Should you really worry to travel in airplane? Let’s look at the data before drawing a conclusion.

#### 3. Movie Recommender System 
[Link](https://github.com/anjanibond/Data-Science/tree/main/Portfolio/Project3)
Using the small MovieLens data set, create a recommender system that allows users to input a movie they like (in the data set) and recommends ten other movies for them to watch. In your write-up, clearly explain the recommender system process and all steps performed. If you are using a method found online, be sure to reference the source. You can use R or Python to complete this assignment. Submit your code and output to the submission link. Make sure to add comments to all of your code and to document your steps, process, and analysis.

#### 4. Predictive Model on Monthly Retail Sales
[Link](https://github.com/anjanibond/Data-Science/tree/main/Portfolio/Project4)
Using the dataset us_retail_sales.csv for this project. This data gives the total monthly retail sales in the US from January 1992 until June 2021. With this dataset, built a predictive model for monthly retails sales. 

#### 5. Stroke Prediction based on risk factors
[Link](https://github.com/anjanibond/Data-Science/tree/main/Portfolio/Project5)
Objective of this  project is to predict the certainty of a person to have this deadly disease based on various parameters such as age, gender, healthy habits, etc. so that this disease can be predicted before it becomes critical and be treated with normal measures and hopefully no lives are lost. 
From the vast pool of machine learning algorithms, I chose few methods to predict accurately.

#### 6. Sentiment Analysis on iPhone Reviews(Amazon)
[Link](https://github.com/anjanibond/Data-Science/tree/main/Portfolio/Project6)
I will be evaluating the overall response of cell phone reviews of previous models of the iPhone from the dataset sourced from the Kaggle website.
To be specific, this will be about iphone X/XE/XS/XR models. The objective is to solve the business problem of how to improve the quality of product further considering the customer reviews and help achieve better profits for the future products.

#### 7. Optimal Feature selection to build models
[Link](https://github.com/anjanibond/Data-Science/tree/main/Portfolio/Project7)
A mushrooms classification dataset has been used to find out optimal feature selection criteria in building various models. 

#### 8. iPhone reviews sentiment analysis
[Link](https://github.com/anjanibond/Data-Science/tree/main/Portfolio/Project8)
I will be evaluating the overall response of cell phone reviews of previous models of the iPhone from the dataset sourced from the Kaggle website.
To be specific, this will be about iphone X/XE/XS/XR models. The objective is to solve the business problem of how to improve the quality of product further considering the customer reviews and help achieve better profits for the future products.

#### 9. Data Visualizations using automobile/car database.
[Link](https://github.com/anjanibond/Data-Science/tree/main/Portfolio/Project9)
Analysis and data visualizations of car data using various sources including kaggle dataset, API and others to analyze the car data and draw conclusions with visualizations/charts.

#### 10. Predict risk variables for heart patients
[Link](https://github.com/anjanibond/Data-Science/tree/main/Portfolio/Project10)
The purpose of this project is to predict the effects of different variables/parameters recorded in the data to predict patient mortality. By predicting so the physicians can determine high risk patients and can take better care of them thereby helping them survive.
